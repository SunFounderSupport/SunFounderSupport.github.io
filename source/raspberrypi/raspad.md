## Black screen without backlight
Is there light in the led below?

If it is not lit after pressing the power button without plugging in, but the three green lights are on after the power is connected, please check the battery connection.</br></br>

If the led light under the power button is on when the power is not connected, please check the screen line</br></br>

If the led light under the power supply is not turned on, please check whether there is something wrong with the power adapter, which can be detected by a multimeter. The inside of the socket is positive and the outside is negative, and the voltage should be 5v</br></br>
